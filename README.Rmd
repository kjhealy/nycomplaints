The dataset comes from CouncilStat, which is used by many NYC Council district offices to enter and track constituent cases that can range from issues around affordable housing, to potholes and pedestrian safety. This dataset aggregates the information that individual staff have input. However, district staffs handle a wide range of complex issues. Each offices uses the program differently, and thus records cases, differently and so comparisons between accounts may be difficult. Not all offices use the program. For more info - http://labs.council.nyc/districts/data/

This is a teaching package; the data are not clean---in particular there are spurious zip codes in the complaints data, as well as other issues.

Data sourced from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Council-Constituent-Services/9hzi-kbqb)

The package also includes `nyc_zips` and `census_vars`. The former is a table of NYC zip codes. The latter is a table the names of some ACS variables.
